# Donation Campaign Website 🌟

Welcome to the Donation Campaign Website! Below are the three major features of this website:

## 1. Search Feature for Donation Categories 🔍

This website provides users with an intuitive search feature to easily find their preferred donation category. Whether they want to contribute to healthcare, education, clothing, or humanitarian causes, users can quickly locate their desired category with the search functionality. This feature enhances the user experience by simplifying the donation process and ensuring that users can easily support the cause closest to their hearts.

## 2. Donations are Displayed in a Pie Chart 📊

Transparency and visual representation of donation categories are crucial aspects of our website. To achieve this, we have implemented a dynamic pie chart that visually represents the distribution of donations. Users can see at a glance how their contributions are making a difference. This feature not only engages users but also fosters trust and accountability by showcasing where their donations are going.

## 3. Donations are Stored in Local Browser Storage 💾

To enhance user convenience and maintain a record of their donation, we have incorporated local browser storage functionality. When a user makes a donation, their record is stored in the local storage of their browser. This ensures that even if they close the browser or return to the website later, their previous donations are remembered, simplifying the donation process for return users. This feature also allows users to track their donation history effortlessly.

We hope you find these features valuable and that they contribute to the success of your donation campaign. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for using our Donation Campaign Website! 😃
